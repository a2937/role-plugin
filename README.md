Role Restore Plugin
================

The Role restore plugin is a simple plugin that allows users who leave and come to servers with
the AvaIre Discord bot to get back their roles.

## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/a2937/role-plugin/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make Ava recognize the plugin.

And you're done!
